# vim_config

This repository contains some basic vim settings that I use on Linux...

Use: 
```sh
# Cloning repository
git clone https://github.com/CR1SS19/vim_config/

# Enter the directory
cd ./vim_config/

# Execute permission to the file
chmod +x vim-setup.sh

# Run the file
./vim-setup.sh
```
